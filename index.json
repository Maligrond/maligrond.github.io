It enables you to synchronize any file in your workspace with other files stored in your Google Drive, your Dropbox and your GitHub accounts. This allows you to keep writing on other devices, collaborate with people you share the file with, integrate easily into your workflow\u0026hellip; The synchronization mechanism takes place every minute in the background, downloading, merging, and uploading file modifications.\nThere are two types of synchronization and they can complement each other:\nThe workspace synchronization will sync all your files, folders and settings automatically. This will allow you to fetch your workspace on any other device.\nTo start syncing your workspace, just sign in with Google in the menu.\nThe file synchronization will keep one file of the workspace synced with one or multiple files in Google Drive, Dropbox or GitHub.\nBefore starting to sync files, you must link an account in the Synchronize sub-menu.\nOpen a file #\rYou can open a file from Google Drive, Dropbox or GitHub by opening the Synchronize sub-menu and clicking Open from.
